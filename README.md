# Undergraduate Essays & Theses

This repository includes my undergraduate essays and theses for
the Bachelor of Advanced Computing R&D (Honours) degree.

## COMP2620 Logic

_Resolving the Material Paradox of Implication from the Principle
of Explosion in Orthodox Logic with Auxiliary Truth Values_
([Logic/main.pdf]) is a short essay discovering the application of
classical logic and the issues rising from the definition of
implication.

An introduction of two addidional values are proposed to resolve
the problem.

The corresponding LaTeX file ([Logic/main.tex]) is also included.

## COMP2550 Advanced Computing R&D Methods

The [research proposal](AccessControl/ResearchProposal.pdf) and
the [literature review](AccessControl/LiteratureReview.pdf) discover
an implmentation of formal logic systems in cyber security by
enhancing access control models.

We explore the characteristics of the existing access control theories,
their limitations and how classical logic is used therein. We then
delve into the possibility of utilising non-classical logic systems
for improving the models.
