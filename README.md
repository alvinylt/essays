## COMP2620 Logic

_Resolving the Material Paradox of Implication from the Principle
of Explosion in Orthodox Logic with Auxiliary Truth Values_
(`Logic/main.pdf`) is a short essay discovering the application of
classical logic and the issues rising from the definition of
implication.

An introduction of two addidional values are proposed to resolve
the problem.

The corresponding LaTeX file (`Logic/main.tex`) is also included.
